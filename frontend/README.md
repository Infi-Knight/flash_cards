## TODO

- cap the character limit in rte with an error message
- cleanup duplicated code
- move tabs to client side pages to improve the performance

## Bugs:
- in some of the cards, the content goes out of card boundary and stays hidden, add overflow or limit max width in the quill class to fix it
- weird column gaps in masonary
- If you try to add an invalid hyperlink in the rich text editor, the UI blows up.
